In Java, errors and exceptions are both types of throwable objects, but they represent different types of problems that can occur during the execution of a program.
Errors are usually caused by serious problems that are outside the control of the program, such as running out of memory or a system crash. Errors are represented by the Error class and its subclasses. Some common examples of errors in Java include:
●	OutOfMemoryError: Thrown when the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs out of memory.
●	StackOverflowError: Thrown when the call stack overflows due to too many method invocations.
●	NoClassDefFoundError: Thrown when a required class cannot be found.
Since errors are generally caused by problems that cannot be recovered from, it’s usually not appropriate for a program to catch errors. Instead, the best course of action is usually to log the error and exit the program.
Exceptions, on the other hand, are used to handle errors that can be recovered from within the program. Exceptions are represented by the Exception class and its subclasses.
●	NullPointerException: Thrown when a null reference is accessed.
●	IllegalArgumentException: Thrown when an illegal argument is passed to a method.
●	IOException: Thrown when an I/O operation fails.
Since exceptions can be caught and handled within a program, it’s common to include code to catch and handle exceptions in Java programs. By handling exceptions, you can provide more informative error messages to users and prevent the program from crashing.

Exception
●	Exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.
●	Exceptions can be recovered by using try-catch block.
●	Exceptions are classified into two types: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions.
●	Checked exceptions are the exceptions that are checked at compile time.
●	Unchecked exceptions are the exceptions that are not checked at compile time.
Error
●	Error is a serious problem that occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.
●	Error cannot be recovered by using try-catch block.
●	Errors are classified into two types: fatal errors and non-fatal errors.
●	Fatal errors are the errors that terminate the program.
●	Non-fatal errors are the errors that do not terminate the program.
